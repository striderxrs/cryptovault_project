CryptoVault - Automatically Encrypted Incremental Cloud Backup using Amazon S3

The main aim of this project was to provide those users who utilize cloud storage services, to easily upload content to their cloud account and, to restore the files from the cloud. The software uses AES Encryption standards and also offers the users an option to encrypt and also to compress the files to be uploaded. The software is also able to store incremental backups on the userâ€™s cloud. The tool uses Amazon s3 backend.

However, its ancient now and needs an overhaul/bugfixing.
